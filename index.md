# fgbio

fgbio is a command line toolkit for working with genomic and particularly next generation sequencing data.

## Getting Started

Releases of fgbio are available from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio/releases) page for the project.  Start by downloading the `.jar` file for the latest release.

To run fgbio you will need [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download/) (aka Java 1.8) or later installed.  To see the version of Java currently installed run the following in a terminal:

```
java -version
```

If the reported version on the first line starts with `1.8` or higher, you are all set.

Once you have Java installed and a release downloaded you can run:

* Run `java -jar fgbio-0.1.4.jar` to get a list of avaiable tools
* Run `java -jar fgbio-0.1.4.jar <Tool Name>` to see detailed usage instructions on any tool

When running tools we recommend the following set of Java options as a starting point though individual tools may need more or less memory depending on the input data:

```
java -Xmx4g -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+AggressiveHeap -jar fgbio.jar ...
```

To save typing this every time you may wish to setup a shell alias, for example:

```
alias fgbio="java -Xmx4g -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+AggressiveHeap -jar /path/to/fgbio.jar
```

## Documentation

Each tool has detailed uage and argument documentation that can be viewed at the command line by running the tool in question with no arguments.

Documentation is also available online:
* Tool usage documentation is available [here](tools/latest)
* Documentation of the various metrics files is available [here](metrics/latest)
* API documentation for developers is available through [javadoc.io](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.fulcrumgenomics/fgbio_2.12).

## Getting Help

The primary mechanism for getting help is to log an issue on the project's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio/issues) page.

### Before Logging An Issue

* Make sure you are running the latest release of fgbio
* Search both open and closed issues for similar problems
* Ensure that your input files are valid (for BAM files we kindly request you run [Picard's ValidateSamFile](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#ValidateSamFile) before logging issues)

### When Logging An Issue

If requesting help with a tool that is failing or producing undesirable results, please include:

* The full command line used to invoke the tool
* The terminal output produced by the tool while running
* Information on the operating system you are running, using `uname -a`
* Information on the version of Java you are running, using `java -version`
