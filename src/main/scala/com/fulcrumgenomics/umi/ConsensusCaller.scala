/**
  * Generic consensus caller class that can be used to produce consensus base calls and qualities from
  * a pileup of raw base calls and qualities.
  *
  * The consensus caller sees the process of going from a DNA source molecule in its original, pristine, state
  * to a sequenced base as having three phases each with their own distinct error profiles:
  *   1) The phase whereby the source molecule is harvested (e.g. cells extracted and lysed) to the point where
  *   some kind of molecular identifier has been attached that will allow for identification of replicates that
  *   are generated from the same original source molecule.  Errors in this phase will be present in all copies
  *   of the molecule that are prepared for sequencing (except where a second error reverts the change).
  *
  *   2) Everything between phases 1 & 3! Generally including any sample preparation activities after a molecular
  *   identifier has been attached but prior to sequencing.  Errors introduced in this phase will be present in
  *   some fraction of the molecules available at sequencing.
  *
  *   3) Sequencing of the molecule (or clonal cluster of molecules) on a sequencer.  E.g. the process of base-by-base
  *   resynthesis and sequencing on an Illumina sequencer _after_ cluster amplification.  Errors in this phase are
  *   captured by the raw base quality scores from the sequencer.
  *
  * @param errorRatePreLabeling an estimate of the error rate (i.e. rate of base substitutions) caused by DNA damage
  *                             prior to any labeling of source molecules. Estimates the rate at which errors from
  *                             Phase 1 described above would be observed if the rest of the process were error-free.
  * @param errorRatePostLabeling an estimate of the error rate (i.e. rate of base substitutions) caused by DNA damage
  *                              post-labeling. Estimates the errors from Phase 2 which would be non-uniform across
  *                              replicates of the same source molecule.
