  """
    |Annotates existing BAM files with UMIs (Unique Molecular Indices, aka Molecular IDs,
    |Molecular barcodes) from a separate FASTQ file. Takes an existing BAM file and a FASTQ
    |file consisting of UMI reads, matches the reads between the files based on read names,
    |and produces an output BAM file where each record is annotated with an optional tag
    |(specified by `attribute`) that contains the read sequence of the UMI.  Trailing read
    |numbers (`/1` or `/2`) are removed from FASTQ read names, as is any text after whitespace,
    |before matching.
    |
    |At the end of execution, reports how many records were processed and how many were
    |missing UMIs. If any read from the BAM file did not have a matching UMI read in the
    |FASTQ file, the program will exit with a non-zero exit status.  The `--fail-fast` option
    |may be specified to cause the program to terminate the first time it finds a records
    |without a matching UMI.
    |
    |In order to avoid sorting the input files, the entire UMI fastq file is read into
    |memory. As a result the program needs to be run with memory proportional the size of
    |the (uncompressed) fastq.
