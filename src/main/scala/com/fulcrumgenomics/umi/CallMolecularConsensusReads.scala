    |Calls consensus sequences from reads with the same unique molecular tag.
    |
    |Reads with the same unique molecular tag are examined base-by-base to assess the likelihood of each base in the
    |source molecule.  The likelihood model is as follows:
    |   1. First, the base qualities are adjusted. The base qualities are assumed to represent the probability of a
    |      sequencing error (i.e. the sequencer observed the wrong base present on the cluster/flowcell/well).  A fixed
    |      value is subtracted from the phred-scaled base qualities (ex. Q30 with a shift of 10 becomes Q20).  Next, the
    |      base qualities are capped to a maximum phred-scaled value.  Finally the base quality are converted to a
    |      probability to incorporate a probability representing the chance of an error from the time the unique
    |      molecular tags were integrated to just prior to sequencing.  The resulting probability is the error rate of
    |      all processes from right after integrating the molecular tag through to the end of sequencing.
    |   2. Next, a consensus sequence is called for all reads with the same unique molecular tag base-by-base.  For a
    |      given base position in the reads, the likelihoods that an A, C, G, or T is the base for the underlying
    |      source molecule respectively are computed by multiplying the likelihood of each read observing the base
    |      position being considered.  The probability of error (from 1.) is used when the observed base does not match
    |      the hypothesized base for the underlying source molecule, while one minus that probability is used otherwise.
    |      The computed likelihoods are normalized by dividing them by the sum of all four likelihoods to produce a
    |      posterior probability, namely the probability that the source molecule was an A, C, G, or T from just after
    |      integrating molecular tag through to sequencing, given the observations.  The base with the maximum posterior
    |      probability as the consensus call, and the posterior probability is used as its raw base quality.
    |   3. Finally, the consensus raw base quality is modified by incorporating the probability of an error prior to
    |      integrating the unique molecular tags.  Therefore, the probability used for the final consensus base
    |      quality is the posterior probability of the source molecule having the consensus base given the observed
    |      reads with the same molecular tag, all the way from sample extraction and through sample and library
    |      preparation, through preparing the library for sequencing (ex. amplification, target selection), and finally,
    |      through sequencing.
    |
    |This tool assumes that reads with the same tag are grouped together (consecutive in the file). Also, this tool
    |calls each end of a pair independently, and does not jointly call bases that overlap within a pair.  Insertion or
    |deletion errors in the reads are not considered in the consensus model.
