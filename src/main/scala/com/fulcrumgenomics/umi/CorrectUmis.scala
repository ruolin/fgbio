  """
    |Corrects UMIs stored in BAM files when a set of fixed UMIs is in use.  If the set of UMIs used in
    |an experiment is known and is a _subset_ of the possible randomers of the same length, it is possible
    |to error-correct UMIs prior to grouping reads by UMI.  This tool takes an input BAM with UMIs in a
    |tag (`RX` by default) and set of known UMIs (either on the command line or in a file) and produces:
    |
    |  1. A new BAM with corrected UMIs in the same tag the UMIs were found in
    |  2. Optionally a set of metrics about the representation of each UMI in the set
    |  3. Optionally a second BAM file of reads whose UMIs could not be corrected within the specific parameters
    |
    |All of the fixed UMIs must be of he same length, and all UMIs in the BAM file must also have the same
    |length.  Multiple UMIs that are concatenated with hyphens (e.g. `AACCAGT-AGGTAGA`) are split apart,
    |corrected individually and then re-assembled.  A read is accepted only if all the UMIs can be corrected.
    |
    |Correction is controlled by two parameters that are applied per-UMI:
    |
    |  1. _--max-mismatches_ controls how many mismatches (no-calls are counted as mismatches) are tolerated
    |         between a UMI as read and a fixed UMI.
    |  2. _--min-distance_ controls how many more mismatches the next best hit must have
    |
    |For example, with two fixed UMIs `AAAAA` and `CCCCC` and `--max-mismatches=3` and `--min-distance=2` the
    |following would happen:
    |
    |  - AAAAA would match to AAAAA
    |  - AAGTG would match to AAAAA with three mismatches because CCCCCC has six mismatches and 6 >= 3 + 2
    |  - AACCA would be rejected because it is 2 mismatches to AAAAA and 3 to CCCCCC and 3 <= 2 + 2
    |
    |The set of fixed UMIs may be specified on the command line using `--umis umi1 umi2 ...` or via one or
    |more files of UMIs with a single sequence per line using `--umi-files umis.txt more_umis.txt`.  If there
    |are multiple UMIs per template, leading to hyphenated UMI tags, the values for the fixed UMIs should
    |be single, non-hyphenated UMIs (e.g. if a record has `RX:Z:ACGT-GGCA`, you would use `--umis ACGT GGCA`).
    |
    |Records which have their UMIs corrected (i.e. the UMI is not identical to one of the expected UMIs but is
    |close enough to be corrected) will by default have their original UMI stored in the `OX` tag. This can be
    |disabled with the `--dont-store-original-umis` option.
    |
    |For a large number of input UMIs, the `--cache-size` option may used to speed up the tool.  To disable
    |using a cache, set the value to `0`.
