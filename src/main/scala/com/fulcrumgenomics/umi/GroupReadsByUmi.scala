  """
    |Groups reads together that appear to have come from the same original molecule. Reads
    |are grouped by template, and then templates are sorted by the 5' mapping positions of
    |the reads from the template, used from earliest mapping position to latest. Reads that
    |have the same end positions are then sub-grouped by UMI sequence.
    |
    |Accepts reads in any order (including `unsorted`) and outputs reads sorted by:
    |
    |   1. The lower genome coordinate of the two outer ends of the templates
    |   2. The sequencing library
    |   3. The assigned UMI tag
    |   4. Read Name
    |
    |Reads are aggressively filtered out so that only high quality read pairs with both ends
    |mapped are taken forward.  (Note: the `MQ` tag is required on reads with mapped mates).
    |This is done with the expectation that the next step is building consensus reads, where
    |it is undesirable to either:
    |
    |   1. Assign reads together that are really from different source molecules
    |   2. Build two groups from reads that are really from the same molecule
    |
    |Errors in mapping reads could lead to both and therefore are minimized.
    |
    |Grouping of UMIs is performed by one of three strategies:
    |
    |1. **identity**:  only reads with identical UMI sequences are grouped together. This strategy
    |                  may be useful for evaluating data, but should generally be avoided as it will
    |                  generate multiple UMI groups per original molecule in the presence of errors.
    |2. **edit**:      reads are clustered into groups such that each read within a group has at least
    |                  one other read in the group with <= edits differences and there are inter-group
    |                  pairings with <= edits differences. Effective when there are small numbers of
    |                  reads per UMI, but breaks down at very high coverage of UMIs.
    |3. **adjacency**: a version of the directed adjacency method described in [umi_tools](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/051755)
    |                  that allows for errors between UMIs but only when there is a count gradient.
    |4. **paired**:    similar to adjacency but for methods that produce template with a pair of UMIs
    |                  such that a read with A-B is related to but not identical to a read with B-A.
    |                  Expects the pair of UMIs to be stored in a single tag, separated by a hyphen
    |                  (e.g. `ACGT-CCGG`).  The molecular IDs produced have more structure than for single
    |                  UMI strategies, and are of the form `{base}/{AB|BA}`. E.g. two UMI pairs would be
    |                  mapped as follows AAAA-GGGG -> 1/AB, GGGG-AAAA -> 1/BA.
    |
    |`edit`, `adjacency` and `paired` make use of the `--edits` parameter to control the matching of
    |non-identical UMIs.
    |
    |By default, all UMIs must be the same length. If `--min-umi-length=len` is specified then reads that have a UMI
    |shorter than `len` will be discarded, and when comparing UMIs of different lengths, the first len bases will be
    |compared, where `len` is the length of the shortest UMI. The UMI length is the number of [ACGT] bases in the UMI
    |(i.e. does not count dashes and other non-ACGT characters). This option is not implemented for reads with UMI pairs
    |(i.e. using the paired assigner).
