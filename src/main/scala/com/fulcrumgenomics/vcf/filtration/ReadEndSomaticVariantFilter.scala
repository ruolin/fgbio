    * Returns true if a base in the pileup (either ref or alt) is congruent with the artifact.
    * I.e. the base is within the first or last few bases of the template _and_ the base as read
    * makes sense given the position.
    *
    * Given a ref allele and alt allele (alt will always be A or T when invoking this method) we infer
    * how the alleles are paired.  E.g. if we are give ref=C alt=A then we pair (C,A) and (G,T)
    * together and think about C and A in similar ways, and G and T in similar ways.
    *
    * Next, it's important to know if we are looking at an observation at the beginning or end of
    * the read (e.g. if the read goes all the way through the template), as this informs how the
    * artifact will present.  See the two examples below for a C>A artifact:
    *
    * Example 1: congruent with the artifact
    *     Ref(+)     CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
    *     R1(+)   5'-CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCa-3'
    *     R2(-)   3'-GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGt-5' (in BAM would also be CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCa)
    *
    * Example 2: incongruent with the artifact
    *     Ref(+)     CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
    *     R1(+)   5'-aCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC-3'
    *     R2(-)   3'-tGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG-5' (in BAM would also be aCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC)
    *
    * In Example 1 we see a C>A substitution at the end of the template, which R1 observes at a C>A substitution
    * _at the end of the read_ and R2 observes as a G>T substitution _at the beginning of the read_.  This is
    * congruent with the model of over-digestion of the 3' end and addition of one or more A nucleotides.
    *
    * In Example 2 we see a C>A substitution at the beginning of the template, which R1 observes at a C>A substitution
    * _at the beginning of the read_ and R2 observes as a G>T substitution _at the end of the read_.  This is
    * NOT congruent with the model of over-digestion of the 3' end and addition of one or more A nucleotides.
    *
    * Therefore for alt observations to be congruent we require that we observe a T (as read by the sequencer)
    * at the start of the read or an A (as read by the sequencer) at the end of the read (where the read spans
    * the whole template).
    *
    * Then for ref observations to be congruent we require an observation of the T-paired allele at the start of
    * the read or the A-paired allele at the end of the read - i.e. they are observations that if converted to
    * alt observations would be congruent.
