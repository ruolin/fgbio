  * A high-precision implementation of the math for binomial probabilities.  This implementation is several
  * times slower (though not orders of magnitude slower) than the implementation in Apache Commons Math, but
  * retains precision throughout the computation where the Commons implementation underflows.
  *
  * One implementation choice to be aware of when using this implementation is that each instance of the
  * class will calculate and cache factorials up to factorial(n) where n is the highest value of n
  * supplied to any call to [[probability()]] or [[cumulativeProbability()]].  Thus to ensure reasonable
  * performance it is recommended to create one instance of this class and reuse it for as many
  * calculations as is practical.
  *
  * @param mc the MathContext to use for controlling precision and rounding. Changing from the default
  *           [[MathContext.UNLIMITED]] can lead to a loss of precision.
