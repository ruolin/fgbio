# Goals

There are many toolkits available for analyzing genomic data; fgbio does not aim to be all things to all people but is specifically focused on providing:

* Robust, well-tested tools.
* An easy to use command-line.
* Documentation for each tool.
* Tools not found anywhere else.
* Open source development for the benefit of the community and our clients.

## Building 

Use ```sbt assembly``` to build an executable jar in ```target/scala-2.11/```.  
Tests may be run with ```sbt test```.
Java SE 8 is required.


## Command line

`java -jar target/scala-2.11/fgbio-0.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar` to see the commands supported.  Use `java -jar target/scala-2.11/fgbio-0.1.2-SNAPSHOT.jar <command>` to see the help message for a particular command.

## Include fgbio in your project

You can include `fgbio` in your project:

```
"com.fulcrumgenomics" %% "fgbio" % "0.1.1"
```

## Overview

Fgbio is a command line tool to perform bioinformatic genomic data analysis. 
The collection of tools within `fgbio` are used by our customers for both ad-hoc data analysis and within their production pipelines.
These tools typically operate on read-level data (ex. FASTQ, SAM, or BAM) or variant-level data (ex. VCF or BCF).
They range from simple tools to filter reads in a BAM file, to tools to compute consensus reads from reads with the same molecular index/tag.
See the [list of tools](#list-of-tools) for more detail on the tools

## List of tools

Below we highlight a few tools that you may find useful.
Please see the help message for a full list of tools available.
In no particular order ...

* Tools to work with unique molecular tags/indexes (Umis). 
  * Annotating/Extract Umis from read-level data: `AnnotateBamWithUmis` and `ExtractUmisFromBam`.
  * Tools to manipulate read-level data containing Umis: `CallMolecularConsensusReads` and `GroupReadsByUmi`
* Tools to manipulate read-level data:
	* Filter read-level data: `FilterBam`.
	* Randomize the order of read-level data: `RandomizeBam`.
	* Update read-level metadata: `SetMateInformation` and `UpdateReadGroups`.
* Miscellaneous tools:
	* Pick molecular indices (ex. sample barcodes, or molecular indexes): `PickIlluminaIndices`.
	* Convert the output of HAPCUT (a tool for phasing variants): `HapCutToVcf`.
	* Find technical or synthetic sequences in read-level data: `FindTechnicalReads`.
    * Assess phased variant calls: `AssessPhasing`.
