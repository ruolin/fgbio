# DemuxFastqs

## Overview
Group: FASTQ

Performs sample demultiplexing on FASTQs.

The sample barcode for each sample in the sample sheet will be compared against the sample barcode bases extracted from
the FASTQs, to assign each read to a sample.  Reads that do not match any sample within the given error tolerance
will be placed in the 'unmatched' file.

The output directory will contain one BAM file per sample in the sample sheet or metadata CSV file, plus a BAM for
reads that could not be assigned to a sample given the criteria.  The output file names will be the concatenation
of sample id, sample name, and sample barcode bases (expected not observed), delimited by "-".  A metrics file
will also be output providing analogous information to the metric described here:
https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/picard-metric-definitions.html#SampleBarcodeMetric

Alternatively, gzipped FASTQs can be written using the "--output-fastqs=true" option instead of BAMs.  For paired
end data, the output will have the suffix "_R1.fastq.gz" and "_R2.fastq.gz" for read one and read two respectively.
The sample barcode and molecular barcodes (concatenated) will be appended to the read name and delimited by a
colon.

The output base qualities will be standardized to Sanger/SAM format.

FASTQs and associated read structures for each read should be given:
- a single fragment read should have one FASTQ and one read structure
- paired end reads should have two FASTQs and two read structures
- a dual-index sample with paired end reads should have four FASTQs and four read structures given: two for the
  two index reads, and two for the template reads.

The read structures may contain sample barcode bases ('B'), molecular identifier bases ('M'), template bases ('T'),
and bases to skip ('S'). Both reads must have template bases.  Any molecular identifiers will be concatenated using
the '-' delimiter and placed in the given SAM record tag ("RX" by default).  Similarly, the sample barcode bases
from the given read will be placed in the "BC" tag.

Metadata about the samples should be given in either an Illumina Experiment Manager sample sheet or a metadata CSV
file.  Formats are described in detail below.

The read structures will be used to extract the observed sample barcode, template bases, and molecular identifiers
from each read.  The observed sample barcode will be matched to the sample barcodes extracted from the bases in
the sample metadata and associated read structures.

## Sample Sheet
The read group's sample id, sample name, and library id all correspond to the similarly named values in the
sample sheet.  Library id will be the sample id if not found, and the platform unit will be the sample name
concatenated with the sample barcode bases delimited by a ".".

The sample section of the sample sheet should contain information related to each sample with the following
columns:
  - Sample_ID:   The sample identifier unique to the sample in the sample sheet.
  - Sample_Name: The sample name.
  - Library_ID:  The library Identifier.  The combination sample name and library identifier should be unique
                 across the samples in the sample sheet.
  - Description: The description of the sample, which will be placed in the description field in the output BAM's
                 read group.  This column may be omitted.

Additionally, the sample barcode should be specified in a column named 'Sample_Barcode'.  The name of the column
containing the sample barcode can be changed using the --column-for-sample-barcode option.  If the sample barcode
is present across multiple reads (ex. dual-index, or inline in both reads of a pair), then the expected barcode
bases from each read should be concatenated and placed in the 'Sample_Barcode' column.  The concatenation should
be in the same order as the order of the reads' FASTQs and read structures given to this tool.

## Metadata CSV
In lieu of a sample sheet, a simple CSV file may be provided with the necessary metadata.  This file should
contain the same columns as described above for the sample sheet (Sample_ID, Sample_Name, Library_ID, and
Description).

## Example Command Line

As an example, if the sequencing run was 2x100bp (paired end) with two 8bp index reads both reading a sample
barcode, as well as an in-line 8bp sample barcode in read one, the command line would be
  --inputs r1.fq i1.fq i2.fq r2.fq --read-structures 8B92T 8B 8B 100T \
    --sample-sheet SampleSheet.csv --metrics metrics.txt --output output_folder
