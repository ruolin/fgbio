# SetMateInformation

## Overview
Group: SAM/BAM

Adds and/or fixes mate information on paired-end reads. Sets the MQ (mate mapping quality),
MC (mate cigar string), ensures all mate-related flag fields are set correctly, and that
the mate reference and mate start position are correct.

Supplementary records are handled correctly (updated with their mate's non-supplemental
attributes).  Secondary alignments are passed through but are not updated.

The input file must be query-name sorted or query-name grouped (i.e. all records from the same
query sequence must be adjacent in the file, though the ordering between queries is unspecified).
